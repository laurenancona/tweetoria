Paraphrase choice based on user traits

PPDB paraphrase pairs and clusters with their associated usage score across three user traits:
a. Gender: male or female
b. Age: <25 or >30
c. Occupational Class: low or high

Contents:
frequencies.tar.gz - contains the raw frequency statistics for all phrases and each trait
pairs.tar.gz - contains files with pairwise usage scores for each trait
clusters.tar.gz - contains files with cluster usage scores for each trait

In pairs and clusters, the negative values are phrases which are more associated with: females, lower occupational class and users over 30 years old.
